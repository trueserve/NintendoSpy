Pixal Art Gamecube NintendoSpy Skin
by Jimmie1717

Images were inspired by BLUEamnesiac: http://blueamnesiac.deviantart.com/gallery/30067688/Pixel-Art
However I did draw all images in this skin myself.

I left the photoshop (.psd) files in this skin for anyone that wants to make more colors, etc.

The ASCII Skin is currently incomplete as I have not made all the same colors but a few are there.
ASCII Skin uses the same buttons as the normal Skin so if you don't have the normal you will need to change the file paths in the "skin.xml" file and copy the images from the normal one.





Trigger Analogs are displayed on the controller handles.
They only display when the trigger is pressed between 65% to 100%.

There are multiple colors for when a button is pressed and the trigger analogs.
However this is not a directly featured change in the NintendoSpy app itself like the background is.
In the "skin.xml" file change the file path for button images to the color you want.
	
	e.g. A button
	image="button/~ColorHere~/a.png"
	
	e.g. L trigger analog
	image="trigger_analog/~ColorHere~/l.png"
	
	change "~ColorHere~" with the color you want
		
	button color's list:
	- white
	- red
	- pink
	- magenta
	- purple
	- blue
	- light blue
	- cyan
	- spring green
	- green
	- lime
	- yellow
	- orange
	
	button and trigger analog color's list:
	- black
	- white
	
You could also mix different colors together.

StarkNebula's Custom GameCube Skins

This format hopefully serves you better:

* This is a simple skin for the hardcore who want to really show off inputs more than
  anything. As such, buttons are by default set to the colourized folder.

* By having controller images as PNGs with alpha, you can add your own BG colour
  to key out with OBS's WindowCapture feature (using any image editor, really, even some
  online editors would work great -- packed in "ColourKeyScreens" are various colours to
  open up and place beneath the controller image.)
  
* Included buttons in PSD format for simple alteration. Excludes D-Pad U/D/L/R.

* Using separate folders for buttons and controllers just makes things manageable.
  
  Happy Streaming!

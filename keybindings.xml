    be pressed at the same time on the monitored gamepad in order to
    send a HOME keypress to the OS.

    <binding output-key="home">
        <button pushed="b0" />
        <button pushed="b1" />
    </binding>

    Here is an example that will press END when the analog stick is
    pushed into a corner.

    <binding output-key="end">
        <analog axis="x" limit="-0.5"" />
        <analog axis="y" limit="0.5" />
    </binding>

    PC Gamepads have the following inputs:
     * b0 through b127
     * axes x, y, z, rx, ry, rz, s0, s1
    Use the skin helper to determine buttons.

    Console controllers should be obvious. Input buttons are lowercase.

    Axes are from -1.000 to 1.000. 0.000 is center.
